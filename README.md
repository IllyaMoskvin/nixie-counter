## Inspiration

I looked at hundreds of nixie clocks while designing this counter. The most direct inspiration for this project turned out to be a clock made by [NixieDream](https://www.etsy.com/shop/NixieDream) on Etsy. I don't know when exactly this clock was made, but by the time I found it through Pinterest in mid-February 2019, it had already been sold.

What did I like about this design? I loved the idea of having the front face of the counter tilt backwards. This way, when the counter was placed on a tabletop, it would face a sitting or standing viewer more head-on than if the front face was simply perpendicular to the table's surface. I liked how the grain of the wood on the sides of this clock emphasized its directionality. Overall, I liked its angles and proportions.

That said, there were things about it I wanted to change. For one, I did not like how deep the nixie tubes sat within the front face. Each nixie tube has a stack of digits in it. Watching the digits change conveys a sense of dimensionality, which gets lost somewhat when the tubes are set so deep. I wanted to clean up the design by moving the button(s) to the rear and hiding the seams between the pieces of wood. Lastly, I wanted to reduce the footprint of this design by foreshortening the back, giving it a more square profile.

Taken in sum, these changes promised to be a challenge, both in terms of woodworking and component layout. Through these changes, my intention was to make my counter stand on its ownâ€”in conversation with NixieDream's clock, but not merely a remix. Here's hoping that I succeeded!
